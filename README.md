# Deloitte Auditor Web Interface for Tax Queries

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Deloitte Auditor Web Interface** project! This platform is specifically developed for Deloitte's audit team specializing in commercial and individual tax matters. This interface facilitates auditors to study US Tax law and obtain appropriate tax deductions for their clients.

## Scenario

As part of the daily responsibilities of Deloitte's auditors, it is essential to understand and apply US Tax law for the benefit of the clients. To streamline this process and make it more efficient, Deloitte's audit and IT teams have collaborated. The objective is to integrate advanced GPT models and develop a web interface. This interface will prompt tax-related questions and save the responses directly to the client's local system.

## Technology

- A web UI developed to prompt only tax-related questions.
- A backend RESTful interface for seamless communication and data retrieval.
- Integration with GPT models to provide accurate and reliable tax-related information.
- Local storage capability to save client-specific responses.

### Prompt Engineering

The web UI is engineered to limit user prompts strictly to tax-related questions. This ensures the relevance and accuracy of the information provided.
